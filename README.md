Gwent is a strategic card game originally introduced in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and later developed as a standalone game. Here is a summary of the rules of Gwent:

1. Objective: The objective of Gwent is to win two out of three rounds by having a higher total score than your opponent.

2. Deck Composition: Each player starts with a deck of at least 25 cards and no more than 40 cards. The deck consists of unit cards, special cards, and faction-specific cards.

3. Game Board: The game board is divided into two main rows for each player, the Melee row and the Ranged row. Some cards have specific abilities based on their placement on these rows.

4. Card Types:
   a. Unit Cards: These cards represent various characters, creatures, and special abilities. Each unit card has a power value.
   b. Special Cards: These cards have various effects and can alter the gameplay by providing buffs, debuffs, or unique abilities.
   c. Leader Cards: Each player has a unique Leader Card that can be used once per game to activate a special ability.

   c. Play Phase: Players take turns playing one card at a time, starting with the player who won the coin flip.
   d. Passing: A player can choose to pass their turn, ending the round for them. Once both players pass consecutively, the round ends.
